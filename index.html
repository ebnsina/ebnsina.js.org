        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a real language. Building a modern dynamic website without knowing it is nonsense. A lot of
            people working on web applications and web sites learnt the language on the job. Code written is often hard
            to understand and hard to maintain. It doesn't follow best practices or standard rules which provoke
            strange behaviours and bugs. Taking time to understand the fundamentals is really important! By doing so
            you can stop being a normal human and become a true web developer.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>JavaScript was introduced by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape Communications. It was submitted few months
            later to Ecma International for consideration as an industry standard. The result standard version is
            ECMAScript.

            Even if the name comes from a partnership between Netscape and Sun Microsystems (distributor of Java)
            JavaScript is not a "light" version of Java.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Definition & properties</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that supports multiple programming styles. It differs from other
            languages such as C++, Java or PHP with its dynamic behaviour, its first-class functions and its
            prototype-based inheritance.

            JavaScript lovers consider these features as the force of the language. It's very common for people who try
            to write JavaScript like they write code in other languages to hate it. Don't make this mistake!</p>

    <div>
        <h1>Usages</h1>

        <p>Even if it was originally designed to work in a browser environment, JavaScript is now used on several
            different platforms. Here are a few examples :

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Web server</li>
            <li>Browser addons/extensions</li>
            <li>Mobile applications</li>
            <li>Databases consoles</li>
            <li>OpenOffice scripts/macros</li>
            <li> Java applications</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Basic Syntax</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive. Lines end by semicolon ;. Block are delimited curly brackets by { }. Comments
            are between /* */ for multiple lines or after // for one line.</p>
    </div>
