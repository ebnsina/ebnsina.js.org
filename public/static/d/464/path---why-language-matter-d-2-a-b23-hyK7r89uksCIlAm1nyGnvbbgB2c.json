It could run on a simple, hypothetical machine. To program early computers, it was necessary to set large arrays of switches in the right position or punch holes in strips of cardboard and feed them to the computer. You can probably imagine how tedious and error-prone this procedure was. Even writing simple programs required much cleverness and discipline. Complex ones were nearly inconceivable.</p>\n<p>Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (the ones and zeros) did give the programmer a profound sense of being a mighty wizard. And that has to be worth something in terms of job satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Each line of the previous program contains a single instruction. It could be written in English like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Store the number 0 in memory location 0.</li>\n<li>Store the number 1 in memory location 1.</li>\n<li>Store the value of memory location 1 in memory location 2.</li>\n<li>Subtract the number 11 from the value in memory location 2.</li>\n<li>If the value in memory location 2 is the number 0, continue with instruction 9.</li>\n<li>Add the value of memory location 1 to memory location 0.</li>\n<li>Add the number 1 to the value of memory location 1.</li>\n<li>Continue with instruction 3.</li>\n<li>Output the value of memory location 0.</li>\n</ol>","excerpt":"Why Language Matter In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages.
